# django-redux-loc8-ARweb
project working with artist Scott Lichstein in NYC, and designer Curt Saxton in Austin, and myself, coding -Greg Willson in Colorado

diretion of code heavily influenced by using redux -react to build tests, and shaping the api around that, and since we all love to use wordpress it seems smart to base alot of the developmebt for loc8 initially around the creation of a really cool plugin for wordpress that makes wordpress mobile sites do amazing AR things with our patron's art. .  :)
